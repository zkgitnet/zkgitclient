/**
 * This package contains classes related to logging functionality for the ZkGitClient application.
 * It provides a custom logging utility that supports colorized output based on log levels for better readability.
 * The main class, {@link ZkGitLogger}, initializes and configures the logger with a custom formatter
 * that applies different colors for each log level (e.g., red for errors, yellow for warnings, blue for info).
 *
 * <p>
 * The logger also formats logs with timestamps and method names to provide detailed and structured logging output.
